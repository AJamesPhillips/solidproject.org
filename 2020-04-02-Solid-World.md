## Agenda

1600 CEST **Welcome** by [Mitzi L치szl칩](https://github.com/Mitzi-Laszlo)

1605 CEST **Solid App Presentation** by [Travis Vachon](https://github.com/travis) (see [app](https://useconcept.art/) and [source code](https://github.com/travis/concept))

Travis Vachon has been developing web applications for 14 years, and during that time he has never been more excited about another web app development platform than he is about Solid.

In his talk, Travis will discuss the design and development of Concept, a collaborative workspace with support for rich text, images, tables and many other features that are currently in development. He'll showcase how Solid has made classically difficult problems like social document sharing and image uploads nearly trivial, and how the richness of the RDF data model will make advanced features like embedded calendars and task boards more straightforward.

1614 CEST **Solid App Presentation** by [David Faveris](https://forum.solidproject.org/u/Smag0) (see [app](https://github.com/scenaristeur/solidarity) and [library](https://github.com/scenaristeur/shighl/blob/master/README.md))

David Faveris is a French developer who has been working on decentralisation and Linked Data since 2013, [read more about David here](http://smag0.blogspot.com/2013/12/smag0-le-projet.html).

In his talk, David Faveris will aim to inspire others to develop on Solid by presenting the [Shighl library](https://github.com/scenaristeur/shighl/blob/master/README.md), which he created and was used to build a long chat Solid app, [Solidarity](https://github.com/scenaristeur/solidarity). David will give an overview of the libraries and tools that he has used to create Solidarity before giving attendees a look at Solid apps, Inbox and Agora. The application Agora is used to store post-data on a users Pod and sends a reference to a centralised Pod in an attempt to mimic mainstream social media platforms of today in a Solid context.

Astrid Gamoneda is a software engineering student at the web semantics [WESO research group at the University of Oviedo](http://www.weso.es/) and she is currently developing her final project while working with the company [Empathy](https://www.empathy.co/).

The [OHMYPOD! app](https://ohmypod.netlify.app/login) focuses on UI/UX improvement of Pods by enhancing the experience to be more human, friendly, frictionless and playful. Astrid Gamoneda Arrunada will showcasing the application which includes new designs and detailing the tools and libraries used. Lastly, she will talk about the plans to implement a new service to convert and save actual tagging data received by search services into the users' Pod with the aim of contextualise user data in Pods.
