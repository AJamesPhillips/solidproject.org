# Writing data into a Solid Pod

Integrating an application to the Solid ecosystem may require storing data in the user's Pod. Let's see how to create directories and files in Pods with different libraries.

## What you'll need for this tutorial

### Interacting entities

- You'll write data into [Cleopatra's Pod](https://cleopatra.solid.community). If you have your own Pod, you can write there instead. 
- If you don't have your own Pod and WebId, you can easily get them on the [solid community server](https://solid.community/).

### Vocabulary and concepts

Solid is based on the [Linked Data Platform (LDP)](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/) standard. In particular, LDP introduces a [vocabulary (ldp:)](https://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#) defining the notion of [ldp:Resource](https://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Resource), representing an HTTP resource, and the notion of [ldp:Container](https://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container), which is a directory-like resource. 

### Proper authorization

- The directory you will work in (i.e. [Cleopatra's sandbox](https://cleopatra.solid.community/public/sandbox/)) gives anybody read/write access. If you also want unauthenticated read/write access to some directory, or to set your own access policy, please set the sharing accordingly using the sharing pane:

![Sandbox sharing]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/patterns/cleopatra_sharing.png)

- If you want to write things to a Pod using an application (e.g. JS code running under a different domain), you will need to add said app as a "Trusted application" in your profile's preferences.

## The fundamental operation: creating a new resource

Creating a new resource can be done with several approaches:
- Sending a `POST` request to its parent container
- Sending a `PUT` request to the created resource IRI
- Sending a `PATCH` request

To specify wether the created resource should be a 'simple' resource (i.e. a document containing data) or a container, you should set the `Link` header in the request:
- to `<http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#BasicContainer>; rel="type"` for an [`ldp:Container`](https://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container) (other container types exist in the [LDP specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/), but they are out of the scope of this tutorial)
- to `<http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource>; rel="type"`for an [`ldp:Resource](https://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Resource) containing RDF
- to a valid IANA type (e.g. `image/jpeg`) for a generic [``ldp:Resource`](https://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Resource)

### Creating a resource with a POST

- The `POST` target must be a container
- The content type must be specified with the `Content-Type` header
- You can suggest a resource name with the `Slug` header, but it is not mandatory for the server to use it as is. See the `Location` header of the responde to know the definitive `IRI` of the created resource.

#### An empty container

```
curl -X POST \
  https://cleopatra.solid.community/public/sandbox/ \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/turtle' \
  -H 'Link: <http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#BasicContainer>; rel="type"' \
  -H 'Slug: DESIRED CONTAINER NAME' \
  -d ''
```

#### A simple RDF file

```
curl -X POST \
  https://cleopatra.solid.community/public/sandbox/ \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/turtle' \
  -H 'Link: <http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource>; rel="type"' \
  -H 'Postman-Token: da967283-d3b6-46c4-8f90-d9895fbddbe1' \
  -H 'Slug: myResource' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -d '
@prefix this: <#>.
@prefix ldp: <http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#>.

this: a ldp:RDFSource.
this:mySubject this:myProperty this:myObject.'
```

### Creating a resource with a PUT

- The `PUT` target is the desired IRI for the created resource
- The content type must be specified with the `Content-Type` header


Notifications should be sent to inboxes, and any resource can advertize for an inbox (not only webids). It's up to the sender and to the receiver to select the appropriate resource when sending/receiving notifications. For instance, when sending a notification specifically related to Cleopatras busy schedule, one might consider addressing it to the inbox advertised by her calendar resource, `https://cleopatra.solid.community/public/calendar/inbox/`, that you can discover by examining the response to a GET on `https://cleopatra.solid.community/public/calendar`.

Let's dereference [cleopatra's webid](https://cleopatra.solid.community/profile/card#me), with a simple HTTP GET. You should be served an RDF document in which, among other things, you will find:
```
@prefix ldp: <http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#>.
@prefix inbox: </inbox/>.

:me
    a schem:Person, n0:Person;
    ...
    ldp:inbox inbox:;
```

From this snippet, we see that the WebId advertises for an inbox, in this case `https://cleopatra.solid.community/inbox/`, thanks to the property `ldp:inbox`. And that's it, no we can get to notification sending!

## Sending a notification

A notification is sent to the previously discovered inbox through a POST request, containing the notification body. Although it is not a strict requirement, a notification can be expressed using the ActivityStreams vocabulary (TODO: add link to voc documentation).

First, Caesar created the event [on his pod](https://jcaesar.solid.community/public/calendar/50BC/Martius/PartyAtCaesarPalace.ttl). He then sends the invite to Cleopatra's calendar inbox:
```
POST /public/calendar/inbox/ HTTPS/1.1
Host: cleopatra.solid.community
Content-Type: text/turtle

@prefix inv: <>.
@prefix as: <https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#>.
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>.
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>.

inv: a as:Invite;
    rdfs:label "Invitation";
    rdfs:comment "You are invited to my book release party";
    as:object <https://jcaesar.solid.community/public/calendar/50BC/Martius/PartyAtCaesarPalace.ttl>.
```

In the response, the Location header indicates the IRI of the created event. In order to get a name nicer than a generated UUID, Caesar could have proposed a name with a Slug header in his request.
