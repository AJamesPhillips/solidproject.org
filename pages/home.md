Pods and apps are separate but compatible so you are free to change apps while keeping your data. For example, if you want to switch messaging app you can take your contacts and chat history along easily, as long as both apps support Solid.

You call the shots: instead of creating an account for each app, have each app find your account. On top of that, your WebID makes it possible for people to connect to you, no matter what Solid apps they are using.

              Websites, you can browse them on any device
              and with a browser you choose.
              Solid gives you that same choice, but for <em>data</em>:
              you can pick the apps you trust
              to handle your personal data.
              To realize such unprecedented interoperability,
              Solid uses the same recipe as the Web:
              following <a href="https://solid.github.io/specification/">open standards and specifications</a>.
